# Corporate Serf Dashboard

The name of this app is in honor of [Corporate Serf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-MShVYe3kY).

This app scans your Kovaak's Stats directory, and builds a plot of the given scenario, plotting Sensitivity vs Score. As
you keep playing and generating new scores, the plot will automatically update in the background.
