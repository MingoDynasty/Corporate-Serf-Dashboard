# 2026-04-27: Keep KovaaK's API Details Behind `ScenarioRankInfo`

Status: Accepted

Decision: UI code consumes `ScenarioRankInfo` and should not know which KovaaK's endpoint produced the data.

Why: Endpoint details, fallback behavior, cache rules, and expected API failures belong in the service layer. This keeps Dash callbacks focused on rendering.

Consequences: Expected KovaaK's API/domain failures should become `ScenarioRankInfo(status=UNKNOWN, error_message=...)` in `api_service.py`. UI code can render `RANKED`, `UNRANKED`, or `UNKNOWN` without duplicating endpoint logic.
