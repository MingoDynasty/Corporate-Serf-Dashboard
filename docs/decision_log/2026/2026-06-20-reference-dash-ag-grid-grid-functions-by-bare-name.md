# 2026-06-20: Reference dash-ag-grid Grid Functions By Bare Name

Status: Accepted

Decision: In dash-ag-grid `{"function": "..."}` strings (`valueFormatter`, `tooltipValueGetter`, `comparator`, `valueGetter`, etc.), reference functions from the `assets/dashAgGridFunctions.js` registry by their **bare name** — `relativeTime(params.value, "Never")`, `nullsLastComparator` — never with a `dagfuncs.` prefix.

Why: dash-ag-grid (35.2.0) does not run these strings as a browser-global eval. It parses each to an AST and evaluates it against a constructed scope that spreads the contents of `window.dashAgGridFunctions` in as bare names (alongside `params`, `agGrid`, `d3`, `dash_clientside`). There is no `dagfuncs` object in that scope — the identifier never appears in the dash-ag-grid bundle — so `dagfuncs.X(...)` resolves to undefined and the expression **silently fails**: the cell renders the raw field value, or the comparator falls back to AG Grid's default sort, with no console error. The `assets/` file's `var dagfuncs = (window.dashAgGridFunctions = ...)` alias is only for *defining* the registry functions.

Consequences: Plain Dash `clientside_callback`s are different — they run in real browser global scope, so there use the full `window.dashAgGridFunctions.X(...)` path (e.g. the home page's "Last played" relative-time callback). This decision corrected two silent bugs: the grid "Last Played" `valueFormatter`/`tooltipValueGetter` (PR #17) and the `NULLS LAST` comparator on all sortable columns (PR #19), the latter broken since the 2026-04-29 "Use Controlled AG Grid JS For Null-Aware Sorting" entry. Verified by decompiling the installed bundle and by a live browser test.
