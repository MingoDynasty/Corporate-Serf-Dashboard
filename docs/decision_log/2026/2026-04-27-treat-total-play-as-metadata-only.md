# 2026-04-27: Treat `total-play` As Metadata Only

Status: Accepted

Decision: Use `/user/scenario/total-play` only to hydrate or upsert scenario metadata such as `scenarioName -> leaderboardId`.

Why: The endpoint can lag behind current leaderboard scores and ranks. `/leaderboard/scores/global` is the authoritative source for current rank.

Consequences: Current-rank lookup should not trust score or rank data from `total-play`. The endpoint remains useful for cache initialization and metadata discovery.
